## Requirements
- Like with the first challenge, choose a few of the above, ideally one from each category, and write a few sentences describing what it does at a high level.
- Consider some of the following when writing:  Is there an entry point?  How is this code executed?  What are the use cases for this code?
- Play around with the code, or some part of it that interests you.  Write a simple script that utilizes this code.
- Try to find an edge case that either throws an exception or otherwise causes unexpected behavior.  Write a test for this case, then modify the code to pass the test.
